Former Manchester City and Southampton striker Bradley Wright-Phillips scored twice to equal the Major League Soccer season goal record as the New York Red Bulls beat Sporting Kansas City 2-0 in the league 's regular-season finale on Sunday .

With his 26th and 27th goals , Wright-Phillips joined Chris Wondolowski -LRB- 2012 -RRB- and Roy Lassiter -LRB- 1996 -RRB- at the top of the list .

This puts him ahead of his rather more illustrious Red Bulls team-mate Thierry Henry , who scored 10 times last season .
