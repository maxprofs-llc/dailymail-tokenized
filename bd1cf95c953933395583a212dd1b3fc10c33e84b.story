Hackers threatened 9/11-style terrorist attacks on cinemas showing the comedy about two journalists -- played by actors James Franco and Seth Rogen -- who are recruited by the CIA to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un .

The federal government confirmed on Wednesday that North Korea was behind the massive hack of Sony , which saw thousands of internal emails leaked .

According to the Daily Beast , an email sent on January 4 from Ms Pascal to Elizabeth Cantillon , former executive vice president of production for Columbia Pictures , simply said : ` Idris should be the next bond -LRB- sic -RRB- . '

If Elba , from Hackney , east London , did follow in Daniel Craig 's footsteps , he would become the first black James Bond . Previous actors to portray 007 on the big screen include Pierce Brosnan , Roger Moore and Sean Connery .

Many have voiced support for Elba to play the British spy , including actor Jamie Foxx who said in an interview earlier this year that he was a big fan of the idea .

Elba himself has also previously expressed desire to play the British spy , telling website Reddit that he would take the role .

` Yes . if it was offered to me , absolutely , ' he said .

The leaked email comes as filming for the latest instalment of the James Bond franchise gets underway . Actor Daniel Craig , 46 , has seen filming on the River Thames , outside London 's Secret Service MI6 headquarters

A Facebook group called ` We want Idris Elba for James Bond ' , which was set up before the leak , also has more than 30,000 likes .

The leaked email comes as filming for the latest instalment of the James Bond franchise gets underway .

Spectre , which follows on from the 2002 release of Skyfall , will be released in the UK in November next year .

Daniel Craig , who is in contract to play Bond for one more movie at Spectre , could be seen filming on the River Thames , outside London 's famed Secret Service MI6 headquarters , last week .

The Liverpudlian , 46 , could also be seen stood in the window of an apartment in Notting Hill , west London , filming scenes for the 24th James Bond film .

Spectre was announced on December 4 and stars including Monica Bellucci -LRB- Lucia Sciarra -RRB- , Christoph Waltz -LRB- Oberhauser -RRB- , and LÃ©a Seydoux -LRB- Madeleine Swann -RRB- have all been confirmed for the movie .

However , the announcement was not without hiccup .

The Sony hacking resulted in the film 's original scripts being leaked , forcing producers to rewrite the plot line and bring in additional writers to help make changes to the ending .

The leak also revealed that Spectre has a budget of over $ 300 million , which is $ 50 million more than its predecessor .
