VIDEO Team Profile : Spain

Humiliated : Spain 's players react after they were beaten 5-1 by Holland on Friday night

One to watch : Jorge Valdivia

Alexis Sanchez and Arturo Vidal tend to hog the limelight for Chile , while the good work of players like 30-year-old Valdivia goes unnoticed . Watch the playmaker in action and look at the way he moves with the ball and switches possession and you would think he was Spanish . He 'll need to be at his best to match Xavi , Xabi Alonso and Sergio Busquets though .

Key clash : Javi Martinez vs Alexis Sanchez

If , as expected , Bayern Munich 's Javi Martinez comes in for the out-of-sorts Gerard Pique alongside Sergio Ramos at the heart of Spain 's defence then he will have his work cut out keeping the lively Alexis Sanchez quiet . Martinez , a central midfielder by trade , will have to cope with the lightning pace of Barcelona forward if Spain are to stay in the tournament .

Best bet :

Chile 's Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal to score at any time -- 4/1

Head-to-head record :

Played 10 , Spain Wins 8 , Draws 2

Considering changes : Spain head coach Vicente Del Bosque saw his side lose 5-1 to Holland

VIDEO All Star XI : Andres Iniesta
