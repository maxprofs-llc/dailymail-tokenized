Emile Heskey did n't exactly advertise his shooting services well on Saturday morning when the former England striker stepped up to take aim at the gaping target in front of him .

The 36-year-old , in England looking for a new club , took part in Soccer AM 's game as the show 's guests aim to get the ball through the hole in front of them from the spot .

Heskey , most recently a striker for the Newcastle Jets in Australia , must have made the rookie move of leaning back too far as his shot sailed up and over the entire target on live television .

The former Leicester City , Liverpool , Birmingham , Wigan and Aston Villa forward declared his search for a new club on after leaving Australia .

Heskey said : ' I have left the Jets . I had two great years there , a wonderful country . I am back in England and I am looking for a new club . '

Among those linked to signing Heskey include League One club Leyton Orient .

Heskey 's gaffe comes after he insisted Danny Welbeck will show the full extent of his qualities after his deadline day move to Arsenal .

The # 16million signing from Manchester United made the right move , says Heskey , and will have a chance to shine under Arsene Wenger .

` He has got the ability to do well there -LSB- at Arsenal -RSB- , ' Heskey told TalkSport . ' I think their style of play will suit him . People do n't realise how good he is .

' -LSB- His ability -RSB- on the ball , his movement and his pace , those three things will help you , especially in an Arsenal team . '
