Families planning a ski trip in Europe this winter are being urged to research the cost of ski passes before they book .

Research by leading travel money provider , ICE -- International Currency Exchange , has found that prices can vary hugely across various European ski resorts .

A six-day child pass in Italy will cost on average # 46.50 -LRB- $ 58.50 -RRB- but you 'll need to stump up # 160 -LRB- $ 200 -RRB- in France .

Bulgaria is the cheapest ski location in Europe , with a six-day ski pass at just # 90 , less than half the cost of a pass in France and Switzerland

ICE has also found that a family of four -LRB- two adults , two children -RRB- could pay # 385 -LRB- $ 486 -RRB- for six-day ski passes in Germany compared to # 715 -LRB- $ 900 -RRB- in France , saving # 333 -LRB- $ 414 -RRB- ; a difference of 85 per cent .

Overall , Germany comes out on top for value within the Eurozone , while Pamporovo in Bulgaria -LRB- outside the Eurozone -RRB- is the cheapest of all the resort costs studied , with a six-day ski pass at just # 90 -LRB- $ 114 -RRB- , less than half the cost of a pass in France and Switzerland .

Germany could be as much as 85 per cent cheaper for a family of four to ski than France

Skiers in the French Alps will be shelling out a fair amount on their ski passes compared to other locations

A family of four would pay # 305 -LRB- $ 384 -RRB- saving over # 400 on the cost of passes in the Eurozone .

` Koko Sarkari , COO of ICE said : ` Ski pass costs are simply part and parcel of any skiing holiday but can make a big dent in the holiday budget .

` With the Pound now offering 1.2418 against the Euro compared to 1.1735 Euros this time last year , holidaymakers are already at an advantage this Christmas , almost # 40 -LRB- $ 50 -RRB- on a # 700 order .

` But you ca n't predict how rates will change so it may pay to lock in the rate now for all the essentials on holiday from ski passes to Apr√®s Ski . '
