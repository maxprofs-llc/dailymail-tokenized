Eyes on the final : Louis van Gaal is one step away from taking Holland to a World Cup final

Team news : Dutch captain Robin van Persie may miss Holland 's World Cup semi-final against Argentina as he is struggling with an upset stomach .

Van Persie has been instrumental in Holland 's run to the last four of the tournament , but he had to train separately from his team-mates on Tuesday after complaining of a stomach problem .

There was some good news for the Holland coach on Tuesday as injury doubts Ron Vlaar and Leroy Fer took part in training .

In an interesting development , midfielder Nigel de Jong was also involved even though he had been expected to miss the rest of the World Cup after suffering a groin injury in the group stage win over Mexico .

For Argentina , manager Alejandro Sabella has been boosted by the return of Sergio Aguero from a muscle injury for the semi-final .

Angel Di Maria may be out , but impressive full-back Marcos Rojo returns from suspension .

Key clash : Robin van Persie -LRB- Holland -RRB- v Ezequiel Garay -LRB- Argentina -RRB-

Van Persie will be hoping his luck is finally in -- he has never scored in the knockout stages of a World Cup and was hugely unlucky not to change that against Costa Rica . Garay will be ready for a physical battle with the Dutch striker but will need to keep an eye on his clever movement and hope Van Persie draws the short straw again .

One to watch : Dirk Kuyt -LRB- Holland -RRB-

The former Liverpool attacker has been played on either wing and at full-back during the competition so far . His versatility has made him a valuable member of Louis Van Gaal 's squad and he could play an important role helping contain Lionel Messi who loves to cut in from wide positions .
