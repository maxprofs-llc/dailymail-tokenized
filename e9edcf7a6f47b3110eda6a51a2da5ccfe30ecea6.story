Chile 's peaceful Atacama Desert , surrounded by terracotta mountains and rolling dunes , had its silence abruptly broken last night .

A powerful explosion on the peak of the 3,000m-high Cerro Amazones mountain rocked the region at around 2pm local time -LRB- 7pm BST -RRB- .

Engineers were blasting away a million tonnes of rock to make way for the most powerful telescope ever to be built .

Named the European Extremely Large Telescope , or E-ELT , the observatory could aid the search for alien life and unravel the long-held mysteries of the universe .

It is due to be completed in 2022 when scientists claim it will be able to take direct images of planets orbiting distant stars .

As the name implies , the telescope will be immense . Around 2,500 tonnes of steel rigging is already heading to Chile to hold a mirror nearly 130ft -LRB- 40m -RRB- wide .

Dubbed the ` world 's biggest eye on the sky ' , it will capture 15 times more light than any other telescope in existence with images 16 times sharper than those produced by Hubble .

A # 1 billion -LRB- $ 1.6 billion -RRB- ` time machine ' , which could reveal mysteries of the universe , is finally complete .

The last giant antenna for Alma , the world 's largest land-based observatory , recently arrived in Chile allowing scientists to peer deeper into the cosmos than ever before .

It is hoped it will allow astronomers to learn about our origins by peering back to almost the first moments after the universe was formed .

The Alma array is situated high on the Chajnantor Plateau , a remote area of the Atacama Desert in northern Chile at 16,400 feet -LRB- 5,000 metres -RRB- above sea level .

There , the dryness and altitude create some of the best conditions for observing the night sky .

With the latest arrival , the observatory combines the forces of 66 radio antennae , most almost 40 feet -LRB- 12 metres -RRB- in diameter .

Combined , they make the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array -LRB- Alma -RRB- accurate enough to see a golf ball nine miles -LRB- 15 km -RRB- away .

Astronomers claim E-ELT could provide a key insight into the first galaxies to form after the Big Bang 14 billion years ago .

They also hope it will shed light on one of the biggest mysteries of our universe - the formation of ` dark matter ' , which ca n't be seen but is believed to make up most of the mass of the cosmos .

` The E-ELT will allow astronomers to reach deeper into space , further back in time and more intimately into the workings of the universe than any other visible to infrared telescope ever built ' , said Dr Aprajita Verma , Deputy Project Scientist for the UK E-ELT project at Oxford University .

` From probing the first galaxies that formed in the universe , to studying extra-solar planets and looking for signs of life , we can expect break through advances and new discoveries with the E-ELT . '

Once the rugged mountain top has been tamed , the # 879m -LRB- $ 1.1 bn -RRB- E-ELT will have ideal conditions for observing deep space .

Its location means it is far above most of Earth 's atmosphere and water vapour , which would otherwise obscure observations .

The telescope is the latest project for the European Southern Observatory -LRB- ESO -RRB- . Britain is one of 15 countries involved in the E-ELT and has invested # 88 million -LRB- $ 149 million -RRB- towards the project .

The design for E-ELT followed plans for something known as the Overwhelmingly Large Telescope -LRB- Owl -RRB- which was hoped to have an aperture of 100 metres - the same distance that Usain Bolt ran in 9.58 seconds .

However , Owl had to be scrapped because of its expensive budget , but Eso said it may still be built

It 's just one of a number of giant telescopes racing against each other to be built first .

Two other major project - the Giant Magellan Telescope and the Thirty Meter Telescope -- are being built alongside Europe 's efforts .

The Giant Magellan Telescope -LRB- GMT -RRB- is currently under construction atop Las Campanas Peak in Chile at an altitude of 8,366 ft -LRB- 2,550 metres -RRB- above sea level .

The GMT is a $ 700 million -LRB- # 420 million -RRB- project being funded by the U.S , Korea and Australia and expected to be operation in around 10 years .

Meanwhile , the $ 1bn -LRB- # 900m -RRB- Thirty Meter Telescope had plans for its 2022 operation approved last year .

It is being constructed on Mauna Kea 's peak in Hawaii which already hosts about a dozen other telescopes .

The race will see sophisticated observatories built on top of mountains in Hawaii and Chile in an attempt to see the wonders hiding in the outer reaches of the cosmos
