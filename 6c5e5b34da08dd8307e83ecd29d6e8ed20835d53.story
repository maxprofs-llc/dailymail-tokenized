England 's Stuart Broad and Joe Root have been named in the International Cricket Council 's Test team of the year .

The mythical side , selected by a panel chaired by the ICC cricket committee chairman and former India captain Anil Kumble , sees Broad and Root rewarded for their work in helping rebuild the England side after their disastrous tour of Australia .

Root made three big hundreds in the English summer , scoring 200 , 154 and 149 , while Broad - one of the few bright spots Down Under - made contributions with both bat and ball and took 19 wickets as India were beaten 3-1 .
