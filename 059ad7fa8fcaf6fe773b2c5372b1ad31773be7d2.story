At the end of a low scoring week at the picturesque Golfclub Schloss Finkenstein , Moritz Lampert was left holding the trophy aloft as winner of the Karnten Golf Open presented by Mazda .

Seven birdies and just a single dropped shot added up to a round of 65 on Sunday as the German posted a 19 under par total to win by a stroke from playing partner Byeong-hun An , with Italy 's Filippo Bergamaschi a shot further back in third position .

This latest success for Lampert , who won his first professional title earlier this year on the Pro Golf Tour , means the 22-year-old will now have a full category on the Challenge Tour for the rest of the year . It will allow the German to plan a proper schedule , and it also sees him jump to fifth on the Rankings , with the top 15 earning their place on The European Tour come the end of the season .

All smiles : Moritz Lampert holds his prize aloft after sealing victory in the Karnten Golf Open

Having just received the trophy , and a rather large cheque for $ 25,600 at the presentation on the 18th green , Lampert was clearly over the moon with his success .

` This is pretty cool , ' said the German , who represents Golf Club St Leon-Rot , part of The European Tour Properties network . ` My first round was n't that great , but since then I have played some really good golf , and for it to turn into a victory this week , well , I ca n't put it into words . It is my first victory , which makes it special , because I have been playing on invites up until now and this just changes my whole schedule , my season , and my goals .

` It 's easy to say now that I saw it coming , but I felt like I was playing well again , and have been hitting the ball like I wanted to . To win takes so much more than just playing well though , as there are so many good guys out here , so you could say I got lucky in the end , as I holed a great putt on 15 to win by one . I 'm just overwhelmed and happy , and ca n't wait to go to Czech Republic next week .

' I knew that 19 or 20 under was going to be needed to win , and luckily I got off to a great start as I was five under through nine . Then I just kept on going , stayed aggressive , and knowing I was close to the lead helped as I knew I could n't get defensive .

` It feels like home here . Where I live we do n't have any mountains , but everyone understands me here , the people are really nice , and the food is amazing . ''

` I 've got a six hour drive now until I get back , and I do n't think my girlfriend knows that I won yet , but I 'm sure there will be some celebrations tomorrow . On Tuesday I go to Czech , so tomorrow will be the day to celebrate . I do n't know what it will be , but I 'm sure my family and my girlfriend will figure something out . '

Coming up just short of Lampert 's winning total was Korea 's An , who birdied his final three holes on Sunday to match his best ever finish on the Challenge Tour , which came at the Scottish Hydro Challenge hosted by Macdonald Hotels and Resorts last June .

While some players might be disappointed to come up just shy of a maiden title , the 22 year old Orlando resident was excited to continue a run of consistent form .

' I played alright today , ' said An . ` Five under is always a decent score , Mo just played great today . I tried my best , and I 'm quite happy with my finish , especially making those birdies in the last few holes .

` I 'm getting closer to winning , I 've still got plenty of golf ahead of me , and I think it 's coming . It is better to play more consistent in my opinion , rather than win and then not play well . I 'd rather do that , play well every week , still trying to win . I am very happy with a second place finish . '

On his own in third place was Bergamaschi , who fired a four under par 67 on Sunday to continue a fine run of form in this event , having finished second 12 months ago .

The Italian finished a stroke clear of overnight leader Cyril Bouniol , who posted his best result of a maiden Challenge Tour campaign by finishing in a tie for fourth , thanks to a Sunday 69 in Carinthia . Alongside him were Jake Roos -LRB- 66 -RRB- , who won the opening event of the season at the Barclays Kenya Open in March , as well as Germany 's Florian Fritsch -LRB- 68 -RRB- , who had lead in the early stages of the final round .

A shot further back were Scotland 's Wallace Booth , who shot a 64 in the final round to move into a tie for seventh with the English pair of Sam Hutsby -LRB- 65 -RRB- and Paul Maddy -LRB- 69 -RRB- , as well as Irishman Ruaidhri McGee -LRB- 67 -RRB- .
