Team news

Swansea

Jazz Richards could make his first Barclays Premier League start for nearly three years with Swansea having problems at right-back for the visit of Newcastle on Saturday .

Angel Rangel serves a one-match suspension after his red card at Sunderland last weekend and Dutch understudy Dwight Tiendalli is nursing a groin injury which has sidelined him since the end of August , so Richards stands by for his first top-flight start since Swansea 's 1-1 draw with Tottenham in December 2011 .

Wilfried Bony should return to lead the line with Bafetimbi Gomis dropping out from the goalless draw at Sunderland , but Jordi Amat -LRB- ankle -RRB- and Leon Britton -LRB- knee -RRB- are still absent .

Provisional squad : Fabianski , Richards , Fernandez , Williams , Taylor , Ki , Shelvey , Routledge , Dyer , Sigurdsson , Bony , Tremmel , Tiendalli , Bartley , Carroll , Emnes , Montero , Gomis , Fulton .

Newcastle

Newcastle boss Alan Pardew will assess striker Papiss Cisse 's match fitness ahead of Saturday 's Barclays Premier League trip to Swansea .

The Senegal international has been used as a substitute in each of the club 's last two league games following his return from a fractured kneecap , but with goals at a premium , his manager would dearly love to have him at his disposal from the start .

Pardew otherwise has no fresh injury problems and while Ryan Taylor -LRB- cruciate ligament -RRB- played in a behind-closed-doors friendly in midweek , he , fellow defender Davide Santon -LRB- knee -RRB- and midfielders Siem de Jong -LRB- thigh -RRB- and Rolando Aarons -LRB- hamstring -RRB- remain on the comeback trail .

Provisional squad : Krul , Elliot , Janmaat , Dummett , Haidara , Coloccini , Williamson , S. Taylor , Tiote , Anita , Sissoko , Colback , Cabella , Gouffran , Obertan , Ameobi , Riviere , Cisse , Perez , Armstrong .
