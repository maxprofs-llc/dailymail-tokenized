Japanese referee Yuichi Nishimura will handle the opening game of the World Cup between Brazil and Croatia as FIFA picked the same official who oversaw the Brazilians ' elimination in the last tournament in South Africa .

FIFA also selected Nicola Rizzoli of Italy to officiate the hotly-anticipated Group B game between world champion Spain and the Holland , a rematch of the ill-tempered final four years ago .

Nishimura will be joined by compatriots Toru Sagara and Toshiyuki Nagi , who will be the assistant referees for Thursday 's tournament a opener at the Itaquerao stadium in Sao Paulo . Iran 's Alireza Faghani is the fourth official .

Chosen one : Yuichi Nishimura will referee the World Cup opener

Man in the middle : Nicola Rizzoli will take charge of Spain versus Holland

Favourites : Luiz Felipe Scolari and Neymar know that there are big expectations placed on Brazil

The 42-year-old Nishimura handled four games at the last World Cup , including Brazil 's loss to the Holland in the quarter-finals . He sent off Brazil 's Felipe Melo in that game for stamping on Arjen Robben as the Brazilians surrendered the lead to lose 2-1 .

Of FIFA 's 25 referees for Brazil , Nishimura is one of five that have been retained from the World Cup in 2010 . The others are Ravshan Irmatov of Uzbekistan , Joel Aguilar of El Salvador , Peter O'Leary of New Zealand and Howard Webb of England , who refereed the final .

Out of control : Howard Webb refereed the 2010 World Cup final and will be at the tournament again
