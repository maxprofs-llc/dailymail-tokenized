Bottom six of the Premier League

It is likely that Poyet 's backroom team of Mauricio Taricco and Charlie Oatway will also leave and Kevin Ball and Paul Bracewell are on standby to take temporary charge .

Poyet insists he wants to fight on but there is a feeling he has accepted that his 18-month tenure is coming to an end . Saturday 's 4-0 defeat at home to Aston Villa left them one point above the relegation zone after a run of one win in 12 matches .

Former Holland and Rangers boss Dick Advocaat is the favourite to replace Poyet . Congerton is close to Frank Arnesen -- they worked together at Chelsea and Hamburg -- and he is thought to have recommended Advocaat for the role .

Sam Allardyce is also high on their shortlist andSportsmail understands the West ham manager , who once played for Sunderland , would be interested in a move to the Stadium of Light .
