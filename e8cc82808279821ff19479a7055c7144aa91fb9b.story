Chelsea 's Dominic Solanke is included in the England under 18 squad to take on Switzerland next week

Liverpool 's Sheyi Ojo , currently on loan at Wigan , has also received a call-up for the double-header

Dewsnip has called four players up for the first time - Fulham goalkeeper Magnus Norman , Sheffield United 's Louis Reed , Tottenham 's Luke Amos and Middlesbrough forward Harry Chapman .

` It 's important to challenge all the England teams , ' said Dewsnip .

` We have played Holland twice , Italy away and then Poland away twice this season and , particularly for this group of players , they did ever so well in winning the Euros last year .

` It is important that we build on that momentum . They are a talented group and we want to give them tough challenges .

Tottenham 's Joshua Onomah -LRB- right -RRB- also makes the squad for the Switzerland games

` Traditionally the Swiss youth teams are very competitive and they will be very well organised and hard to beat .

` We want to pit our wits against that and see if we can perform well and win both games -- carrying on that momentum to take them into their under 19 year next season . '
