Italy coach Antonio Conte believes that players of Italian descent should be free to decide whether they want to play for the ` azzurri ' .

Conte 's latest call-ups , Argentine-born Franco Vazquez and Brazilian-born Eder , have caused a stir in Italy even though both players possess Italian passports .

` I 'm not the first -LRB- to call-up a player of Italian descent -RRB- and I wo n't be last , ' Conte told a news conference on Monday .

Brazilian-born Eder -LRB- right -RRB- is one of two players not born in Italy to be called up by Antonio Conte

The Italy manager had defended his right to call up foreign-born players to the national squad

Argentine-born Franco Vazquez -LRB- left -RRB- has an Italian mother and made it clear he wanted to play for the azzurri

` In the past -LRB- Mauro -RRB- Camoranesi -LRB- Mauro -RRB- won the World Cup with Italy . -LRB- Christian -RRB- Ledesma , -LRB- Gabriel -RRB- Paletta , Thiago Motta , Amauri and Romulo all played with the national team .

` At the last World Cup , of the 736 players that took part 83 were born in a different country from the one they were playing for , ' Conte added .

Inter Milan coach Roberto Mancini expressed a different opinion earlier on Monday .

Former City boss Roberto Mancini had previously disagreed with foreign-born players being picked

' I believe that an Italian player deserves to play for Italy , ' Mancini said .

` Anyone who was n't born in Italy , even though he may have Italian relatives , should n't be allowed to play . At least this is my opinion . '

Conte said Vazquez had made it clear right from the start that he wanted to represent Italy .

` It 's not that I forced him to accept , ' the coach added .

Mauro Camoranesi -LRB- right -RRB- was born in Argentina but won the 2006 World Cup playing for Italy

Vazquez 's mother was born in Padua and Eder 's great grand - father was from Treviso .
