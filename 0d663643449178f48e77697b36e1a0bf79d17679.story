Former Liverpool manager Graeme Souness believes Nemanja Matic is better than retired Chelsea defensive midfielder Claude Makelele .

Souness lists Matic 's hold-up play , sense of danger and ` constant threat ' among the reasons why the 26-year-old is greater than the man that inspired the position to be dubbed the ` Makelele Role ' .

` Maybe only when you play with him do you appreciate how good he is . He 's exactly what Arsenal needed , maybe what Liverpool needed , what -LRB- Manchester -RRB- United needed , ' Souness wrote in his Sunday Times column .

Matic is more of a ` constant threat ' than what Makelele used to be at Stamford Bridge , believes Souness

` As a midfielder , you want to get your head up and hit balls in to your striker but who 's the face looking back at you ? It used to be Makelele and now it is Matic .

` He 's better than Makelele , has a better range of passing and will get around the pitch better .

` He 's only 26 , but has already mastered the position and , like -LRB- Cesc -RRB- Fabregas , will improve . He 's bigger physically and a threat from set pieces . '

Matic and his Chelsea team-mates travel to Old Trafford to face Manchester United on Sunday .
