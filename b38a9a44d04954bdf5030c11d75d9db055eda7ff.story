Chef Simon Rogan 's restaurant L'Enclume has been ranked the best in Britain for the second year running by an influential guide .

The Cumbrian eatery won a perfect 10 cooking score alongside two other restaurants , Heston Blumenthal 's The Fat Duck and Restaurant Gordon Ramsay , the first time in 15 years that the Good Food Guide to Britain 's top restaurants awarded three full marks simultaneously .

In 1999 , that honour was shared by Marco Pierre White 's Oak Room , Nico Ladenis at Chez Nico and female chef Gunn Eriksen at the Altnaharrie Inn at Loch Broom , Ullapool , in Scotland .

Simon Rogan 's restaurant L'Enclume was voted the best in the country for the second year running , now the 45-year-old chef has taken over the running of the prestigious restaurant in Claridges , in London

Heston Blumenthal 's Fat Duck restaurant in Bray , Berkshire also was commended by judges

` Now the domain of Clare Smyth , with support from what is without doubt one of the best front-of-house teams in the UK , this most impressive of London 's premier restaurants is back in that elite club .

` Further congratulations , too , for Smyth is the first female chef to achieve our top score in 15 years . With her brilliantly artistic , elegant , modern French cooking she perfectly complements the witty , cerebral Fat Duck and the sensual farm-to-table delights of L'Enclume at the pinnacle of our top 50 list . '

Rogan said he felt ` so privileged to be at the number one spot for a second year ' .

He said : ` The full 10 rating really is a reflection of all the continued focus and improvements we have been undertaking at L'Enclume every single month .

` The team just keeps on getting stronger and stronger , and we now also have a hugely skilled front-of-house staff who more than match our culinary standards . '
