Roma forwards Gervinho and Miralem Pjanic are expected to play despite minor injuries .

Rudi Garcia has no concerns about the state of mind of midfielder Daniele de Rossi .

De Rossi was sent off in Saturday 's draw against Sassuolo , days after reports emerged claiming his ex-wife Tamara Pisnoli - to whom he was married from 2006-09 - had been arrested as part of an investigation into an alleged kidnapping scandal .

Garcia said : ` Daniele is fine . We wo n't have him for the Genoa game , but he 's a very important player , a great champion and a crucial figure in the dressing room .

` He 's played over 100 times for Italy , he 's a champion both on the field and in life . '

Key match stats -LRB- supplied by Opta -RRB-

Roma would qualify for the Champions League last 16 for the first time in four seasons with a win . Even a draw would be enough if CSKA also draw with Bayern Munich . A goalless draw would be enough if CSKA do n't win against Bayern .

In the only group with all its members able to qualify for the last 16 , City 's fate depends on the CSKA result .

If Manuel Pellegrini 's side lose against Roma , both City and CSKA will be out of the Champions League this season .

Gervinho has the joint-highest shooting accuracy among players with more than five attempts at target -LRB- 87.5 per cent , alongside Benzema -RRB- .

Sergio Ag√ºero has scored five goals in the Champions League this season , just one goal behind his personal record in a single season set last term .

Roma have won five of their last seven European home games against English opposition -LRB- D1 L1 -RRB- .

Manchester City have never won a European game away from home against an Italian side -LRB- D2 L2 -RRB- .

Roma have not been able to score more than one goal in the Champions League this season since MD1 against CSKA Moscow -LRB- 5-1 -RRB- .

That game was Roma 's only CL win in their last eight games -LRB- D3 L4 -RRB- .

With their victory over Bayern Munich in the last game -LRB- 3-2 -RRB- , the Citizens ended a run of six CL games without a win -LRB- D2 L4 -RRB- , their worst such run in the competition .
