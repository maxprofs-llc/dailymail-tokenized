Madonna may have decided to abandon her own undergraduate education in favor of focusing on her then-burgeoning music career , but that has n't stopped her from offering some sage advice to her Lourdes , who is currently a college freshman .

During an interview with the Today show 's Carson Daly , the 56-year-old singer , whose daughter is currently enrolled at the University of Michigan , Madonna 's alma mater , revealed that she gave the teenager three key pieces of advice , before she started at college .

` Try to do everything in moderation , ' she said of the wisdom she imparted to Lourdes , 18 , ` Try not to kill all your brain cells . And try to go to class . '

Everything in moderation : Madonna , 56 , revealed to the Today show 's Carson Daly that she offered her daughter Lourdes three pieces of advice before she left for college

Worry : The chart-topper admitted that she is still concerned about her daughter 's well being

And while to many , Madonna is a globally-successful super star , she added that - when it comes to her daughter - she worried and frets just like any other mother .

` I 'm very , you know , worried , ' she told father-of-three Carson .

' -LSB- I always ask her -RSB- : `` Are you OK ? Are you getting enough sleep ? Are you eating right ? ''

` You know , I set up a humidifier in her room with eucalyptus oil . I was worried about the fact that she did n't have enough towels , Q-tips , you know . '

But , despite her constant worries about her teenage daughter , who is following in her mother 's footsteps by studying performing arts , it does n't look like Madonna will be allowed anywhere near the campus in the near future - at least if Lourdes has anything to do with it .

Colleagues : Madonna and Lourdes have worked together in the past , collaborating on their Material Girl clothing line , which is a joint venture

Up and comer : Lourdes , now 18 , pictured in February 2008 -LRB- L -RRB- and December 2009 -LRB- R -RRB- , is used to sharing the spotlight with her famous mother , and often attends events alongside the popstar

Family ties : Madonna now has four children -LRB- from left to right -RRB- - David , nine , Lourdes , Mercy , nine , and Rocco , 14

` I 'm not allowed at -LSB- football -RSB- games , '' she admitted . ` You think my daughter wants me at a game ? '

Luckily , the chart-topper is n't short of activities to help her take her mind off her daughter 's college activities .

The mother-of-four will release her 13th studio album , Rebel Heart , tomorrow , three months after someone leaked early versions of more than a dozen of the songs online .

And although she is looking forward to the release - explaining that she is both ` excited ' and ` nervous ' - Madonna admitted that she is still ` frustrated ' by the whole incident .

' I mean , it 's a process , ' she said .

` Music is really personal to me . A lot of the stuff is out there that I had no intention of ever finishing . They 're , like , scribbles on a pad . You know what I mean ? It 's unspeakably embarrassing . '
