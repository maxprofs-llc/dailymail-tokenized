Pep Guardiola admits Champions League semi-final defeat to Real Madrid was the ` biggest f *** - up ' of his life as a coach

Pep Guardiola admits that he could see himself managing Manchester United one day -LRB- and he turned down Manchester City and Chelsea for the Bayern Munich job ! -RRB-

It 's a feverish , tense , agonising final . Bayern equalise 51 seconds after the official 120 minutes have been played . Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson has added one minute for stoppages , and there are nine seconds to go when Javi Martinez , a player who only three days ago was booked in for surgery , only for Guardiola to cancel those plans , scores for Bayern .

Once again , they 're going head-to-head with Chelsea in a penalty shootout , and everyone 's thoughts turn to the Allianz Arena , one year ago . That day the English team beat Bayern in the Champions League final , in a penalty shootout . This could be payback time but , given the option , Guardiola would n't have wished for penalties . In the last four weeks the men from Munich have scored only three of the five penalties they have taken .

In the middle of all the euphoria Pep steps up to the plate , emotional but icily calm . He calls his people together in one big huddle . Everyone is there : doctors , physios , assistant coaches , players , substitutes and even the injured men , like -LRB- Bastian -RRB- Schweinsteiger . This is Pep at his brilliant best . The guy who rises to the big occasions and dazzles his men . Just as everyone is expecting him to mobilise his players with a call to arms of epic proportions , Pep tells them a simple story .

The front cover of new book Pep Confidential

Relaxed and smiling , he pays no heed to the thousands of frenzied supporters around them . Apparently unaffected by the tension , he issues no battle cry , opting instead for an anecdote . About water polo .

` Lads , I do n't know how to take penalties myself . I 've never taken one in my life . But here 's the best penalty taker in the whole world . '

And he points to a figure half hidden , right at the back of the huddle .

` I 'm talking about Manel -LSB- Estiarte -RSB- . He was the best water polo player in the world . He took penalties better than anyone . Hundreds of them . Water polo is like football . Only four out of every five penalty kicks hit the target , but Manel put them all away ! He is the world expert on penalties . '

Pep has n't just managed to get the players ' attention . He has completely changed the expressions on their faces . They had been waiting for war cries and motivational oratory , an adrenaline boost .

What they receive , standing here in the midst of the clamouring , heaving mass of humanity that rocks the stadium , is a simple tale .

-LRB- Daniel -RRB- Van Buyten and -LRB- Tom -RRB- Starke stand just behind Pep in their tracksuits , hugging each other ; Doctor -LRB- Hans -RRB- Muller-Wohlfhart is beside them . -LRB- Toni -RRB- Kroos , -LRB- Philipp -RRB- Lahm and -LRB- Franck -RRB- Ribery are right at the front . -LRB- David -RRB- Alaba is leaning his elbow on -LRB- Thomas -RRB- Muller , also wearing a tracksuit , like -LRB- Arjen -RRB- Robben .

Then there 's a second circle : Javi Mart√≠nez , -LRB- Xherdan -RRB- Shaqiri , Dante , -LRB- Jerome -RRB- Boateng and -LRB- Mario -RRB- Mandzukic ; the assistant coaches , Domenec Torrent and Hermann Gerland ; Kirchhoff , the substitute ; physio Gianni Bianchi ; fitness coaches Lorenzo Buenaventura and Andreas Kornmayer ; -LRB- Mario -RRB- Gotze ; Claudio Pizarro ; Rafinha and Contento .

Matthias Sammer and Bastian Schweinsteiger are slightly separated from the main group and Manuel Neuer is n't here . He 's off getting Toni Tapalovic 's advice about the Chelsea penalty takers . Estiarte , too , has stepped back a few metres .

The players are smiling . Silent but relaxed . They 're enjoying the tone of this team talk . ` I 've learned two things from Manel and his penalties , so listen up . These are the only two things you need to do now .

` Firstly , make up your mind immediately as to where you 're going to put the ball and stick with that decision . I 'll say it again . Decide now , and do n't change your mind no matter what happens . Secondly , keep telling yourselves that you 're going to score . Repeat it a thousand times and do n't stop until after you 've taken the penalty . Do n't worry and do n't change your minds . '

` What a team talk . Incredible ! ' Sammer says later .

But Pep has n't finished . He gives them his advice and then says : ` Lads , there 's no list . You can choose whether or not to take one . You choose . You 're all going to score anyway , so you decide who 's taking them . Who 's up for it ? '

Alaba is the first to step forward , Kroos lifts his left hand next , followed quickly by Lahm . Pep gives his captain one of his little taps on the cheek . Next , Ribery adds his name to the list and the coach slaps him encouragingly on the chest . It 's Shaqiri 's turn after that and he 's rewarded with a ` Bravo , Shaq ! '

The players have come up with the list themselves , but what about the order they 'll take them in ? ` You sort that out . Take them in any order you want . Whatever you 're comfortable with . It does n't matter anyway , because they 're all going in . '

They decide to take them in the same order they volunteered . The referee indicates that it 's time and they all turn away . Pep grabs Ribery and Lahm , stopping the whole group in their tracks .

` Just one last thing . Do n't forget . You 've decided where you 're putting the ball . Go and do it . And from now until you shoot keep telling yourself , `` It 's going in '' . With every step you take , say it , `` Goal , goal , goal ... '' '

Of the seven players who had practised on Monday scoring 42 out of 42 , only Kroos and Shaqiri are penalty takers today . Muller and Robben have both been substituted . Pizarro started on the substitutes bench and of course Schweinsteiger is injured .

Of the players who had not taken part in the practice session , Alaba , Lahm and Ribery have been happy to volunteer . All five score . Neuer saves Chelsea 's fifth penalty , taken by Romelu Lukaku , and Bayern have won the title that has so far eluded them .

Ribery lifts the trophy as his team-mates are covered in confetti following their victory in Prague

Pep has his first trophy with Bayern and his third European Super Cup . Voted man of the match , Ribery dedicates the honour to his boss . ' I know how much this means to him , his first title . I also know about his old rivalry with Mourinho . '

The Portuguese coach has left the pitch without congratulating Guardiola , in stark contrast to the obvious warmth between the two teams .

An hour later , in a corner of the press room in Prague 's Eden Stadion , Guardiola and Estiarte chat to a couple of Catalan journalists , Isaac Lluch , of Ara and Ramon Besa of El Pais .

Pep is absolutely radiant . His eyes are shining with happiness , but above all there is a sense of enormous relief . ` The team needed this win . If we had n't won , I do n't know how we would have moved forward . '
