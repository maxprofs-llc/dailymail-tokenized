Commentary on social media about films and TV shows can generate millions of pounds in free advertising for the locations featured on screen , new research has found .

According to a study by EuroScreen , ` chatter ' on Twitter , Facebook and other social media platforms about the locations seen on the big screen can lead to a tourism boom .

Tweeting about London after watching an episode of Sherlock , or sharing a beautiful picture of Malta seen in Game of Thrones has a direct impact on tourism to those destinations , the research claims .

The new insight into the links between film and television productions and tourism was revealed at an international screen tourism conference today by Film London , the lead partner for major European project EuroScreen .

Adrian Wootton , CEO of Film London and British Film Commission , said : ` This research shows that productions do n't just sell cinema tickets and box sets , they also sell the places where they 're made . Quite simply , this is free advertising , and emphasises the power of screen productions as a tourism driver . '

The research was commissioned by EuroScreen , an INTERREG IVC-funded initiative which seeks to capitalise on the major economic and cultural opportunities afforded by ` screen tourism ' ; this being people visiting a country , city or location which they have seen in feature films or on television .

The research was conducted by social media intelligence agency Human Digital , who processed comments and interactions across sites including Twitter , Facebook , Reddit and Pinterest .

Their research examined activity relating to the four European locations along with a range of films and television shows linked to these places .

Their analysis found a clear correlation between place and screen , with the resulting ` chatter ' - likes , mentions , retweets - equivalent to paid-for advertising ranging from tens of thousands to millions of pounds . It is believed to be the first time such methodology has been applied to the tourist industry .

The research was announced at the Seen on Screen : Capitalising on Screen Tourism conference in London .

The figures highlight the regions and productions analysed by Human Digital . The monetary value equates to the least value of the free ` earned ' location exposure/conversation in advertising terms .
